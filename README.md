### Overview

PCollections serves as a [persistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) and immutable analogue of the Java Collections Framework. This includes **efficient**, **thread-safe**, **generic**, **immutable**, and **persistent** stacks, maps, vectors, sets, and bags, **compatible** with their Java Collections counterparts.

Persistent and immutable datatypes are increasingly appreciated as a **simple**, **design-friendly**, **concurrency-friendly**, and sometimes more time- and space-efficient alternative to mutable datatypes.

### Persistent versus Unmodifiable

Note that these immutable collections are very different from the immutable collections returned by Java's [Collections.unmodifiableCollection()](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableCollection(java.util.Collection)>) and similar methods. The difference is that Java's unmodifiable collections have no producers, whereas PCollections have very efficient producers.

Thus if you have an unmodifiable Collection `x` and you want a new Collection `x2` consisting of the elements of `x` in addition to some element `e`, you would have to do something like:

```Java
Collection x2 = new HashSet(x);
x2.add(e);
```

which involves copying all of `x`, using linear time and space.

If, on the other hand, you have a PCollection `y` you can simply say:

```Java
PCollection y2 = y.plus(e);
```

which still leaves `y` untouched but generally requires little or no copying, using time and space much more efficiently.

### Usage

PCollections are created using producers and static factory methods. Some example static factory methods are [`HashTreePSet.empty()`](<https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/HashTreePSet.html#empty()>) which returns an empty [PSet](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PSet.html), while `HashTreePSet.singleton(e)` returns a PSet containing just the element `e`, and `HashTreePSet.from(collection)` returns a PSet containing the same elements as `collection`. See [Example Code](#example-code) below for an example of using producers.

The same `empty()`, `singleton()`, and `from()` factory methods are found in each of the PCollections implementations, which currently include one concrete implementation for each abstract type:

- [HashTreePMap](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/HashTreePMap.html) provides a [PMap](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PMap.html) implementation, analogous to Java's HashMap.
- [TreePMap](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/TreePMap.html) provides a
  [PSortedMap](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PSortedMap.html) implementation,
  analogous to Java's TreeMap.
- [ConsPStack](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/ConsPStack.html) provides a [PStack](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PStack.html) implementation, analogous to Java's LinkedList.
- [TreePVector](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/TreePVector.html) provides a [PVector](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PVector.html) implementation, analogous to Java's ArrayList.
- [HashTreePSet](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/HashTreePSet.html) provides a [PSet](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PSet.html) implementation, analogous to Java's HashSet.
- [TreePSet](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/TreePSet.html) provides a
  [PSortedSet](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PSortedSet.html) implementation,
  analogous to Java's TreeSet.
- [HashTreePBag](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/HashTreePBag.html) provides a [PBag](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.pcollections/pcollections/latest/org.pcollections/org/pcollections/PBag.html) implementation, which is unordered like a set but can contain duplicate elements.

PCollections are highly interoperable with Java Collections:

- Every PCollection is a java.util.Collection.
- Every PMap is a java.util.Map.
- Every PSequence is a java.util.List.
  - This includes every PStack and every PVector.
- Every PSet is a java.util.Set.
- Every PSortedMap is a java.util.SortedMap and java.util.NavigableMap.
- Every PSortedSet is a java.util.SortedSet and java.util.NavigableSet.

PCollections uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), which establishes a strong correspondence between API changes and version numbering.

PCollections is in the [Maven Central repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.pcollections), under org.pcollections. Thus the Maven coordinates for PCollections are:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.pcollections</groupId>
    <artifactId>pcollections</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'org.pcollections:pcollections:4.0.2'
```

### Example Code

The following gives a very simple example of using PCollections, including the static factory method HashTreePSet.empty() and the producer plus(e):

```Java
import org.pcollections.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String... args) {
    PSet<String> set = HashTreePSet.empty();
    set = set.plus("something");

    System.out.println(set);
    System.out.println(set.plus("something else"));
    System.out.println(set);
  }
}
```

Running this program gives the following output:

```
[something]
[something else, something]
[something]
```

### Building from source

To build the project from source [clone the repository](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections) and then run `./gradlew`

### Related Work

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/reference/data_structures), [Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/introduction.html), and [kotlinx.collections.immutable](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.collections.immutable) also provide persistent collections on the JVM, but they are less interoperable with Java. Both [Guava](https://guava.dev/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableCollection.html) and [java.util.Collections](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableCollection(java.util.Collection)>) provide immutable collections but they are not persistent—that is, they do not provide efficient producers—so they are not nearly as useful.
